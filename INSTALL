INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install HTML::WikiConverter is via the CPAN shell:

  % cpan HTML::WikiConverter

You may also obtain the source as a .tar.gz, in which case you can run
the following after unpacking:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make && make test && make install

The 'make install' step attempts to install the module and the
html2wiki utility into something like /usr or /usr/local, which
probably won't work unless you're an administrator. To work around
this, you may install into your own local directory like so:

  % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/myperl5
  % make && make test && make install
