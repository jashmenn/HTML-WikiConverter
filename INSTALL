HTML::WikiConverter installation
================================

HTML::WikiConverter is an HTML to wiki converter capable of converting
HTML source into a variety of wiki dialects. It's aimed at folks who
are converting vanilla HTML websites into wikis.

The HTML::WikiConverter module itself is an interface to its various
dialect modules (e.g. HTML::WikiConverter::MediaWiki). To install the
latest version of HTML::WikiConverter and all of its dialects, install
Bundle::HTMLWikiConverter from CPAN:

  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::HTMLWikiConverter'

For just the interface:

  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter'

Individual dialects can be installed separately, e.g.:

  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter::MediaWiki'
  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter::UseMod'
  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter::Oddmuse'

Installing by hand
==================

You may also obtain the source as a .tar.gz, in which case you can run
the following after unpacking:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make && make test && make install

The 'make install' step attempts to install the module and the
html2wiki utility into something like /usr or /usr/local, which
probably won't work unless you're an administrator. To work around
this, you may install into your own local directory like so:

  % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/myperl5
  % make && make test && make install

Installing the web application
==============================

Included in this distribution is HTML::WikiConverter::WebApp, which is
a CGI::Application-based web application that interfaces with
HTML::WikiConverter and any installed dialects. (Note that you will
need to have CGI::Application installed to use this feature.)

The H::WC::WebApp module is installed automatically. The remaining
files necessary for the web application are in the cgi directory. To
install these files, copy the cgi directory to your cgi-bin directory
and provide proper file permissions to files contained therein. For
example:

  % cp -r cgi /var/www/cgi-bin/wc

For permissions, something like this ought to work:

  % chmod 655 /var/www/cgi-bin/wc/index.cgi
  % chmod a+r /var/www/cgi-bin/wc/templates/*

Update the %config hash in /var/www/cgi-bin/wc/index.cgi to point to
the templates directory.

  # Inside /var/www/cgi-bin/wc/index.cgi:
  my %config = (
    template_path => '/var/www/cgi-bin/wc/templates',
  );

The template filler should then be available via a standard URL:

  http://www.yourhost.com/cgi-bin/wc/index.cgi
