HTML::WikiConverter version 0.50
================================

HTML::WikiConverter is an HTML to wiki converter capable of converting
HTML source into a variety of wiki dialects. It's aimed at folks who are
converting vanilla HTML websites into wikis.

The following dialects are supported:

  DokuWiki    Kwiki
  MediaWiki   MoinMoin
  Oddmuse     PhpWiki
  PmWiki      SnipSnap
  TikiWiki    UseMod
  WakkaWiki   WikkaWiki

SYNOPSIS

Converting HTML to wiki markup is easy:

  use HTML::WikiConverter;
  my $wc = new HTML::WikiConverter( dialect => 'MediaWiki' );
  print $wc->html2wiki( $html );

Or via the command-line with the included utility:

  % html2wiki --dialect MediaWiki input.html > output.mw

There's also a web interface if you're so inclined:

UNICODE SUPPORT

As of version 0.40, HTML::WikiConverter supports multiple character
encodings via the 'encodings' attribute.

PREREQUISITES

  * HTML::Tree for building and manipulating HTML trees
  * HTML::Entities for encoding HTML entities
  * URI for handling URIs in links

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.50

As of version 0.50, HTML::WikiConverter no longer ships with all its
wiki dialects. This saves bandwidth, allows me to release more often,
and otherwise eases maintenance.

The easiest way to install a dialect module is via the CPAN shell. For
example, to install the MediaWiki and UseMod dialects:

  % cpan HTML::WikiConverter::MediaWiki
  % cpan HTML::WikiConverter::UseMod
