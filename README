NAME
    HTML::WikiConverter - An HTML-to-wiki markup converter

SYNOPSIS

    use HTML::WikiConverter;

    my $wc = new HTML::WikiConverter(
      html => $html_source
    );

    print $wc->output, "\n";

DESCRIPTION

    HTML::WikiConverter provides simple conversion from HTML source to
    wiki markup. A sample web interface is available at

      http://diberri.dyndns.org/html2wiki.html

    if you would like to try the module before you install it.

FEATURES

    In addition to converting most HTML tags into corresponding wiki
    markup, HTML::WikiConverter offers a few extra features:

    o Supports image thumbnails
    
      If an IMG tag is found with a WIDTH attribute that differs from
      the actual width of the image, then the resulting [[Image:]]
      markup will contain the "thumb" keyword followed by the
      thumbnail width.

    o Recognizes DIVs used to align images

      If an IMG tag (or an IMG contained within an A tag) is the only
      child element of a DIV that uses STYLE or CLASS to align the
      image, then the alignment is taken from the DIV and placed in
      the [[Image:]] markup.

    o Supports table attributes
    
      Attributes for table tags (TABLE, TR, etc.) will be added
      appropriately to the resulting table markup.

    o Tidies wiki markup

      Attempts to remove unnecessary (and often ugly) spacing between
      chunks of HTML. Text contained within PRE tags is left
      untouched.

    o Supports Unicode

      Translates high bit characters to their HTML entity equivalents,
      in this module's first attempt at supporting Unicode.

INSTALLATION

    The simplest way to install is via the CPAN shell:

      cpan> install HTML::WikiConverter

    The next best thing is:

      > perl Makefile.PL
      > make
      > make test
      > make install
