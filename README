HTML::WikiConverter version 0.52
================================

HTML::WikiConverter is an HTML to wiki converter capable of converting
HTML source into a variety of wiki dialects. It's aimed at folks who
are converting vanilla HTML websites into wikis.

The following dialects are supported:

  DokuWiki    Kwiki
  MediaWiki   MoinMoin
  Oddmuse     PhpWiki
  PmWiki      SnipSnap
  TikiWiki    UseMod
  WakkaWiki   WikkaWiki

INSTALLATION

As of version 0.50, HTML::WikiConverter is just an interface to
individual dialect modules; it no longer ships with all its wiki
dialects. To install the latest version of HTML::WikiConverter and all
its dialects, install Bundle::HTMLWikiConverter from CPAN:

  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::HTMLWikiConverter'

For just the HTML::WikiConverter interface:

  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter'

Individual dialects can be installed separately; for example:

  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter::MediaWiki'
  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter::PhpWiki'

SYNOPSIS

Converting HTML to wiki markup is easy:

  use HTML::WikiConverter;
  my $wc = new HTML::WikiConverter( dialect => 'MediaWiki' );
  print $wc->html2wiki( $html );

Or via the command-line with the included utility:

  % html2wiki --dialect MediaWiki input.html > output.mw

There's also a web interface if you're so inclined:

UNICODE SUPPORT

As of version 0.40, HTML::WikiConverter supports multiple character
encodings via the 'encodings' attribute.

PREREQUISITES

  * Test::More for testing
  * HTML::TreeBuilder for building and manipulating HTML trees
  * HTML::Entities for encoding HTML entities
  * URI and URI::Escape for handling URIs in links
  * Class::Data::Inheritable
  * Params::Validate
  * Exporter

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.52

  * Consolidate 'wiki_page_extractor' attribute into 'wiki_uri'
  * Use File::Slurp (if available) for file slurping
  * 'wrap_in_html' now applies to html read from files too
  * Fix bug in how 'wrap_in_html' is applied to html (previously it
    was clobbering HTML read from files)
  * Coalesce 'strip_*' into 'strip_tags' attribute, which accepts an
    arrayref
  * Document the 'preprocess' attribute
  * Add attribute() and rule() methods for greater flexibility when
    defining attributes and rules (hence new Params::Validate and
    Class::Data::Inheritable prereqs); old style using attributes()
    and rules() will be supported until 0.60
  * Dialects can now inherit from H::WC via 'use HTML::WikiConverter
    -dialect' (old style will be supported until 0.60)
  * Dialects no longer have to be within the HTML::WikiConverter
    namespace

THANKS TO

  * Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for suggestions and code
  * Dave Schaefer for the (forthcoming) PbWiki dialect and the idea behind the
    attribute() method
  * Martin Kudlvasr for fixing a bug in how 'wrap_in_html' was applied to
    HTML read from files
