HTML::WikiConverter version 0.20
================================

HTML::WikiConverter is an HTML to wiki converter, capable of
converting HTML source into a variety of wiki markups (called
"dialects"). The only supported dialect is MediaWiki (the wiki engine
for Wikipedia), but other dialects can be added with little effort.

Converting HTML to wiki markup is easy:

  use HTML::WikiConverter;
  my $wc = new HTML::WikiConverter( dialect => 'MediaWiki' );
  print $wc->html2wiki($html);

If you'd like to try the module out before installing, there's
a Web interface to the MediaWiki dialect available at:

INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is via the cpan script:

  % cpan install HTML::WikiConverter

although you can always:

   % perl Makefile.PL
   % make
   % make test
   % make install

DEPENDENCIES
