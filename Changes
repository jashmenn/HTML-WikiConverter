# Change log for HTML::WikiConverter

version: 0.12
date:    Thu May 14 5:23:08 PDT 2004
changes:
 - Bug fix: removed reference to non-existent 'has_parent'
   method within '_elem_has_ancestor' function
 - Bug fix: fixed potential bug in 'wikify_list_item'
   which used $node->parent->tag eq '...' instead of
   _elem_has_ancestor($node, '...')
 - Now supports definition lists via ; and :
 - Now supports indentation via :
 - Replaced code handler for P tag with flank handler
 - Replaced code handler for OL/UL tags with flank handlers
 - Renamed 'wikify_heading' method to 'wikify_h' for
   consistency with other wikify_* handlers
 - NOWIKI blocks are now preserved
 - Introduced beginnings of Unicode support with the
   use of HTML entities to HTML-escape high-bit characters
 - Added more tests to t/test.t

version: 0.11
date:    Sun May 10 1:01:09 PDT 2004
changes:
 - added wikify_default code handler for tags
   that should be preserved. (Tags without handlers
   are removed from the wiki markup by default.
   So, for example, "<TAG>content</TAG>" becomes
   "content". By assigning the TAG to wikify_default,
   the resulting wiki markup is "<tag>content</tag>".)
   All tag attributes are preserved as well.
 - Added wikify_span
 - Now preserves FONT, SUP, and SUB tags
 - SPAN tags are converted into FONT if possible

version: 0.10
date:    Thu May 07 3:10:04 PDT 2004
changes:
  - Initial release
