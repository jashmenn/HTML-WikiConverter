# Change log for HTML::WikiConverter

version: 0.16
date:    Fri May 28 12:33:14 PDT 2004
 - Added 'elem_style_attr_props' method for parsing the STYLE attribute
 - Tags that are meant to be stripped (e.g. HTML, META, HEAD) no longer
   need to be explicitly assigned an empty replacement handler (they
   can simply be excluded from the list of tag handlers)
 - Added handling of non-breaking elements (e.g. in some dialects, such
   as MediaWiki, P tags should not have any embedded newlines)
 - Fixed whitespace handling in H::W::Dialect
 - Documentation additions
 - MediaWiki: added colspan and rowspan to allowed TD attrs
 - MW: Now supports 'pretty_tables' option for making nice borders/shading
 - MW: Removed arbitrary 20-char limit in conversion of {{...}} magic
 - MW: "[1]"-style links are now handled properly
 - MW: Hex codes/HTML entities in URLs now translated to appropriate char
   (requires URI::Escape)
 - MW: Major list handling cleanup and bug fixes
 - MW: Added new realworld test (my User: page)

version: 0.15
date:    Thu May 20 8:50:37 PDT 2004

version: 0.14
date:    Sun May 17 7:18:09 PDT 2004
changes
 - 'wikify_default' now called 'passthru'
 - NOWIKI blocks are no longer preserved

   aboids apparent bugs in HTML::TreeBuilder that
   prevent proper tag handling
 - Added trim method

   trimmed
 - Can now handle "[[language]]s" links (with trailing
   characters)

version: 0.12
date:    Thu May 14 5:23:08 PDT 2004
changes:
 - Bug fix: removed reference to non-existent 'has_parent'
   method within '_elem_has_ancestor' function
 - Bug fix: fixed potential bug in 'wikify_list_item'
   which used $node->parent->tag eq '...' instead of
   _elem_has_ancestor($node, '...')
 - Now supports definition lists via ; and :
 - Now supports indentation via :
 - Replaced code handler for P tag with flank handler
 - Replaced code handler for OL/UL tags with flank handlers
 - Renamed 'wikify_heading' method to 'wikify_h' for
   consistency with other wikify_* handlers
 - NOWIKI blocks are now preserved
 - Introduced beginnings of Unicode support with the
   use of HTML entities to HTML-escape high-bit characters
 - Added more tests to t/test.t

version: 0.11
date:    Sun May 10 1:01:09 PDT 2004
changes:
 - added wikify_default code handler for tags
   that should be preserved. (Tags without handlers
   are removed from the wiki markup by default.
   So, for example, "<TAG>content</TAG>" becomes
   "content". By assigning the TAG to wikify_default,
   the resulting wiki markup is "<tag>content</tag>".)
   All tag attributes are preserved as well.
 - Added wikify_span
 - Now preserves FONT, SUP, and SUB tags
 - SPAN tags are converted into FONT if possible

version: 0.10
date:    Thu May 07 3:10:04 PDT 2004
changes:
  - Initial release
